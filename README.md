# Html-start-practice
I started learning HTML5 since the past couple of weeks, but I was practicing offline, hence now i decided that i should store my practice here. This will be a repository containing all my practice. I'm not creating anything new or improving any thing, the one thing I'm improving is my knowledge and my skill.
